#Calligraphr is the app we developed during Google Glass Hackathon that won us the first prize.

Characters are the major barriers for chinese language learners. As an extreme case, the single character biang has 56 strokes. 
Learning characters is not only about memorizing how characters look, but also how they should be writtern, how different parts of a character should be porpotioned to each others. Needless to say, there are hundreds of writing styles. For this matter, stroke order plays an important role.

Although learning curve is very steep for the language, effective learning methods seem to be rear. In elementary school, for example, chinese students practise writing on a special paper with guide lines. This learning experience is not ideal, because it's very repetitive, not interactive and just boring.

Introducting calligraphr, our hack for the google glass education hackathon to improve this learning experience. We use augmented reality to project an interactive character animation on a real paper. Students can use the traditional brush and ink to trace down the character stroke by stroke. Once finished, our program can automatically judge the work and give a score. Like games, characters are organized by difficulties. Users can start with simple characters and proceed to further levels.

Technology is under the blame of ruining traditions. We forget how to write because of the keyboard. We don't know how to spell due to auto completion. But really they shouldn't be a pair of enemies. With wearable technologies like google glass, we can bridge something old and classic with something new.
