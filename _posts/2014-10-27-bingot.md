I started a new project called bingot (bit+ingot), a simple implementation of cryptocurrency. The goal of this project is for me to understand cryptocurrency down to the code level. I have always been fascinated about bitcoin. However after reading so many articles, I still lack understanding of some implementation details. Although the real bitcoin code base has grown too large to study, two months ago, I found [BasicCoin](https://github.com/zack-bitcoin/basiccoin), a simple cryptocurrency implementation in Python, which inspired me to write bingot. 

bingot is written in C++ with Qt and cryptopp. It's not aimed at becoming another currency, but rather a simple implementation with good documentation that could serve as a start point for other innovative projects using blockchain. At this point, Iâ€™m still evaluating the correctness of my program. This step will take some time because cryptocurrency is a very dynamic system. An implementation needs to consider timing (For example, cryptocurrency assumes that the proof of work algorithm takes way longer time than does message broadcast.) and probabilities. And the implementation has to offer fault tolerant features. Therefore static analysis won't work, the program needs to be put through experiments.
